                  The picture on the left is a digital-to-film photo I took for my mother. The biggest feature of film is graininess. Perhaps the most salient quality of the film grain is motion, the grain is always moving, swimming, which means that even a still object, like a flower on a table, that flower is alive even if it's not moving. This is why I like Chinese film most.This graininess gives the whole picture a sense of breath and movement

                  <span>The beauty of photography is the perceptual display of ideas</span><br />
                  There is such a photographer in the annals of photography, his name is Man Ray. Living in the 20th century, Man Ray was deeply influenced by the Dada school and surrealism at that time, and the content he shot was full of dreamlike feeling. Man Ray had profound painting skills and had many influences on photography techniques. Moreover, he met a woman named Gigi who cooperated with him and became a legend in the history of photography. He once said, "For me, photography is just a means to expression, not an end." This is the concept of aesthetics, and we apply it to our photographic practice through our own cognition of beauty itself, beauty as a form, beauty as a feeling, etc. This is the essence of photography aesthetics, that kind of ideological beauty. Take Man Ray's book "A Girl and Five Tears" for example, to show the idea he wants to express with photographic techniques is the emotional display of the idea. In the fixed "boundary" of the artistic atmosphere in the society at that time, he could easily break through this "boundary", which is precisely his deep understanding and application of photography and aesthetics

This also trained me to do everything steadfast, persistent hard character. I started dancing when I was four years old. I studied for eight years and got Professional Level 11 certificate. But unfortunately, in that year, I fractured my ankle and rarely had the opportunity to perform on stage again. Good dance, even if you jump many, many times will not feel tired, each jump will have a new feeling. And with the growth of their own experience, there will be different perceptions, jumping out will give people a different feeling

Dance is not a kind of dance, but a form of dance expression. It is a kind of individual expression that does not adhere to tradition. It is a dancer's pursuit of art and an organic integration of trends, new elements and dance.
